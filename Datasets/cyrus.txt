According to the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], [[Croesus]] met the wise [[Athenian]] ruler [[Solon]] and asked if wealth did not ensure happiness. [[Solon]] replied, "He who possesses great stores of riches is no nearer happiness than he who has what suffices for his daily needs." [[Herodotus]] viewed [[Cyrus]]'s defeat of [[Croesus]] as proof that wealth does not guarantee fulfillment.
