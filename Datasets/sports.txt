Something had to change if the players in light blue were not to blow the league title. Even then [[Leicester]] still had promising moments on the counterattack, not least when [[Harry Maguire]]'s run from defense led to [[James Maddison]] firing narrowly wide from 20 yards. [[Schmeichel]] saved again from [[Ag√ºero]] but the home side's momentum was building. Then the ball was at [[Kompany]]'s feet and, in that moment, he produced the reminder that big players like to contribute big moments.
