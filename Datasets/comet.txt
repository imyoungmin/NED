The [[Philae]], a robotic lander, was launched from the [[Rosetta]] spacecraft after a 10-year journey and successfully latched onto the hurling rock, later named [[Agilkia]]. Though [[Philae]] ran out of battery more quickly than expected since it inadvertently landed in a shady spot on the comet that prevented some recharging via solar panels, it was still able to transmit data back to scientists on the ground that was previously out of reach.
