[[Madonna]] had planned to have [[LaChapelle]] direct her video for "Hung Up," the first single from [[Confessions on a Dance Floor]], and the pair had worked out a concept that involved incorporating all types of dance techniques from around the world â€” including the krumping style featured in [[LaChapelle]]'s documentary "[[Rize]]."

Thrown into the middle of [[Madonna]]'s whirlwind, [[Johan Renck]] had to hit the ground running, just like many of the dancers cast for the clip. [[Madonna]] wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as [[Daniel Campos]], Miss Prissy from [[LaChapelle]]'s "[[Rize]]" crew and traceur [[Sebastien Foucan]], a practitioner of parkour, a philosophical French sport that involves moving via uninterrupted motion, whether over, under, through or around objects. "It's not about the music, but the bodily expression," [[Johan Renck]] said. "We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco."
