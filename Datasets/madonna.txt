[[Madonna]] had planned to have [[LaChapelle]] direct her video for "Hung Up," the first single from [[Confessions on a Dance Floor]], and the pair had worked out a concept that involved incorporating all types of dance techniques from around the world — including the krumping style featured in [[LaChapelle]]'s documentary "[[Rize]]."

Thrown into the middle of [[Madonna]]'s whirlwind, [[Johan Renck]] had to hit the ground running, just like many of the dancers cast for the clip. [[Madonna]] wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as [[Daniel Campos]], Miss Prissy from [[LaChapelle]]'s "Rize" crew and traceur [[Sebastien Foucan]], a practitioner of parkour, a philosophical French sport that involves moving via uninterrupted motion, whether over, under, through or around objects. "It's not about the music, but the bodily expression," [[Johan Renck]] said. "We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco."

All of the dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 in half a day, for a total of six days of shooting, while [[Madonna]]'s solo dance number — inspired by the [[Travolta]]'s film trifecta of "[[Saturday Night Fever]]," "[[Grease]]" and "[[Perfect]]" — only took three hours to shoot ([[Madonna]] has said the video is "really a tribute to dance — and [[Travolta]]").

But while [[Madonna]] certainly could have made more demands, she was willing to bend a bit. "She says, 'I'm not a director, that's why I have a director,' and she gives you a lot of slack," he recalled. Not that [[Madonna]] lets anything go by uncommented. "She's a very good client, but she's tough. I can't say it's not tough. But she's good." Her toughness paid off to the tune of five [[VMA]] nominations, including Video of the Year.
